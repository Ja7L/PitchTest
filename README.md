# PitchTest

## Audio Pitch Test with Web Audio API and other instruments

This project is a web app designed to function as a tuner, displaying the closest musical note and pitch inputted to the microphone, rounded to the nearest Hertz (Hz). This was built with a focus on providing a user-friendly interface/UI. Additionally, the application includes some more features such as a simple note/pitch player and interactive pianos which can be played using either a mouse or keyboard.

## Project details
* This project was made with Flask (Flask & Flask-Session)
* The bulk of the tuner was implemented in [pitch-detection.js](/static/pitch-detection.js)
